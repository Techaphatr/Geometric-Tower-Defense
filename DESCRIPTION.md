This project will be a top-view, 2D, Tower Defense game, in which players can place each unit to defeat those “corrupted.” The game will contain 3 maps which are split into ‘easy’, ‘normal’, and ‘extreme’, in each round monster will be released per wave which health, speed, and quantity will depend on the number of waves that player pass.
